# Data Structure & Algorithms

Here is a list of some main algorithms to study and their respective complexities:

1. Bubble Sort - O(n^2)
2. Selection Sort - O(n^2)
3. Insertion Sort - O(n^2)
4. Merge Sort - O(n log n)
5. Quick Sort - O(n log n)
6. Heap Sort - O(n log n)
7. Binary Search - O(log n)
8. Breadth-First Search (BFS) - O(V + E)
9. Depth-First Search (DFS) - O(V + E)
10. Dijkstra's Algorithm - O((V + E) log V)

Please note that these complexities are based on the average case scenarios. Actual performance may vary depending on the specific implementation and input data.
